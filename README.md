# Type Your Shark

A simple typing game with 3 levels of difficulty and 3 challenge levels to test and improve your typing proficiency. 

## Motivation

Type Your Shark is loosely based on the original flash game Typer Shark that no longer exists. It was a game used to increase typing speed and accuracy. Type Your Shark is my take on the original to target programmers. I achieved this with long and obscure words and a "spell-check" level to sharpen all the necessary programming skills in 3 challenging ways. The goal was to cut down on typos and mistakes to maximize the individual's coding flow, while still having fun. 

## Getting Started
